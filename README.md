# current-month-week-number 

Get the current month week number

## Motivation

The main reason I created this package was as a result of wanting to do something that I thought was easy but after spending hours without getting it right and a lot of suggested solutions on stack overflow not achieving what I wanted. 
I vowed that once I get it working I'll publish the solution for someone to use it if they ever have similar requirement that I had. So this is me fulfilling my vow :); I hope someone will find this useful.

## Installation

```sh
npm install current-month-week-number --save

## Usage

```sh
var weekNumber = require('current-month-week-number');
var numberNumberIs = weekNumber.weekNumberOfCurrentMonth(11);
```

## Tests

npm install
npm test
