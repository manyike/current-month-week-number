# current-month-week-number
A simple function to get the current month week number
# Motivation
The main reason I created this package was as a result of wanting to do something that I thought was easy but after spending hours without getting it right and a lot of suggested solutions on stackoverflow not achieving what I wanted. I vowed that once I get it working I'll publish the solution for someone to use it if they ever have similar requirement that I had. So this is me fulfilling my vow :); I hope someone will find this useful.
